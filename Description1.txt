My code has two parts to it, the process_image function and the convolve function. The convolve function takes in three parameters, i (the x coordinate of the pixel), j (the y coordinate), and the image. It then computes the convolution of the vertical or horizontal Prewitt template with the 3x3 matrix surrounding the (x,y) coordinate. If vertical is defined as 1, it uses the vertical template, else it does the horizontal template. In my process image function, I simply iterate through the entire image with a doubhle for loop starting at the coordinate (1,1) and ending at the coordinate (DIM-1, DIM-1) computing the convolution for each pixel and using it as the new value for the coordinate in the image. I then readjust the size of the image to be [DIM-2][DIM-2].
